My Senior Project on building a Self-Driving Car.

Currently working on Lane Detection program. houghlinesp is the most recent program. Next steps are determining center line of the road and then creating an equation for the angle that the car would need to turn if not driving directly in the center of the road.


1. Take 15-20 images with raspi_TakeImg.py
2. Run camera calibration with raspi_CamCal.py
3. Run raspi_Drive to inititate autonomous driving
